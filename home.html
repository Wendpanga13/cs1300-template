      <div class="questions">
        <p style="text-align:center">A gas stove allows users to cook meals. Twisting the corresponding button turns a burner’s flames on. And the user can adjust the temperature accordingly using the same button.</p> 
        <p style="text-align:center">But are gas stoves efficient and easy to use? To find out, I asked the following questions to 3 people using a gas stove:</p>
